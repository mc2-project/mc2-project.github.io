MC\ :sup:`2`
==============

**Securely analyze and learn from your confidential data in the cloud using tools and libraries you already know and love**

MC\ :sup:`2` is a platform that enables users to securely but easily run analytics and machine learning on their confidential data in the cloud. Using secure enclaves, MC\ :sup:`2` allows users to run Spark jobs and train XGBoost models while keeping their data encrypted at all times. While providing significant additional security guarantees, MC\ :sup:`2` preserves the API exposed by Spark SQL and XGBoost.
